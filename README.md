Qt-based student address book management system
This is a big assignment at the end of my freshman year, written by me as the captain and my team.  
This QT project is relatively basic, suitable for beginners to learn to make a program with UI interface and background images. The functions of this project include: adding, deleting, modifying, querying, sorting, visualizing charts, file import and export, and of course, my teammates also designed painted eggshell.
